# README Generator

## Description

This is a terminal command line application that generates readme.md files based on user's input. With the help of this application, a user can easily create a well written README by following all the prompts. To create the license, I created pre-typed options for the user to select from in order to prevent the user to type everything out.

## Installation

In order to run the app, one would need to type 'node index.js' inside the terminal. A series of questions will appear and user must answer them accordingly. Once everything is answered, the write file function will then create a readme (sample can be viewed and is titled READMEtest.md) based off of all the user input.
